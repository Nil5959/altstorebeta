AltStore now supports installing, refreshing, and updating apps completely on device if you're jailbroken, NO computer required 🎉\n\nTo enable on-device signing, tap \"Install AltDaemon\" in the Settings tab, then install AltDaemon.deb with Filza or another package manager. Once installed, AltDaemon will run in the background acting as a local AltServer, performing the tasks AltStore can't as a sandboxed app. This allows AltStore to keep running on non-jailbroken devices, while still taking advantage of on-device signing when possible.\n\nWe want to release this to everyone ASAP, so please let us know any problems you encounter running AltDaemon! But most importantly, we hope you enjoy using AltStore without being bound to your computer 🥳",
